## PassMedPlus: PassMed Progress Tracker Extension

Hi! I'm Kay, y3 medic at Manchester uni. I've made a Google Chrome extension that automatically extracts your progress data from PassMed and syncs it with your own progress tracker. Heatmap is visibly quite unhelpful imo so this tracker employs more appropriate graph types.

## Installation

1. Place this folder somewhere (e.g. your desktop).
2. Open google chrome, locate extension icon (puzzle piece-like icon).
3. Go to "Manage Extension".
4. Click on "Load Unpacked" on the top left.
5. Select this entire folder.

## General Instruction

I injected extension buttons to https://www.passmedicine.com/menu.php or https://www.passmedicine.com/menu.php?revise=all only (i.e. you should load one of these specific URLs). 

"Sync Progress" button allows your browser to read your past progress data. This is done by redirecting you to "Review Questions" section and read all problems you've solved in the past. Occasionally you may see sync process that never ends- if so just reload the page and it should work. I'm guessing this happens when there's been a while since last login, but I'm too lazy to fix it sorry.

Once synced, click on "Progress Tracker" button to access your full dashboard.

If you have any question, could you please re-read the instructions.

## Caveat

This works only on Google Chrome, meaning that you cannot use this on Safari, Firebox, or any other extension. This is due to their security restrictions. Furthermore, iOS and Android do not allow for any extension loading. I understand many of you use PassMed on iPad and I agree this is an absolute inconvenience. I feel sorry for you...
